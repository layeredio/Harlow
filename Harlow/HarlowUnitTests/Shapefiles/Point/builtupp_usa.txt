    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer includes Global Map data showing cities and towns in the United States, Puerto Rico, and 
        the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The data are a modified version of the National Atlas of the United 
        States 1:1,000,000-scale cities and towns of the United States; those source data were derived from the 
        Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) and the U.S. Census Bureau National Places Gazetteer files.  

        Global Map refers to these locations as Built-up Area (point) and defines them as areas containing a 
        concentration of buildings and other structures (smaller than Built-up Area (face)).  National Atlas cities 
        or towns are defined as places with a recorded population, usually with at least one central area that 
        provides commercial activities.  Cities are generally larger than towns; no distinction is made between 
        cities and towns in this map layer.  No attempt has been made to reconcile the Global Map and National 
        Atlas feature definitions.
      Purpose:
        Global Map data are part of a cooperative effort among national mapping organizations around the world to 
        produce and maintain a standard set of basic cartographic data that supports global investigations of 
        natural and human-built environments.  Participating nations prepare data using a common data structure 
        and description to ensure compatibility and to tangibly promote the tenets of the Global Spatial Data 
        Infrastructure. 

        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional 
        areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:1,000,000-scale data.  No 
        responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          The 2M_Cities, GNIS, and 2010Census_Gazetteer data sets were all loaded into ArcGIS.  The GNIS data are 
          considered the most authoritative source, and the Census data are considered the next most authoritative 
          source.

          The 2M_Cities and GNIS data were compared.  Cities that were included in both sources were 
          identified and added to the data set, using the location from GNIS.

          The 2010Census_Gazetteer and GNIS data were compared.  Cities that were included in both sources 
          were identified and added to the data set, using the location from GNIS.  

          The 2010Census_Gazetteer and 2M_Cities data were compared.  Cities that were included in both 
          sources but that were not in GNIS were added to the data set, using the location from 
          2010Census_Gazetteer.

          The result was a file that included all the cities and towns from 2010Census_Gazetteer, as well 
          as some other cities and towns.  If there was a GNIS position available, that was used; if no 
          GNIS position was available the Census position was used.

          Attribute fields were updated as necessary.  The attribute GNIS_ID was added from GNIS to 
          identify all populated places and any other cities or towns that were in GNIS.  The attribute 
          ANSICODE was added to all cities or towns that were in the 2010Census_Gazetteer; included are 
          most of the cities designated as "census" or "civil" in GNIS.  There are some "census" and 
          "civil" points in GNIS that are not in 2010Census_Gazetteer; for these locations the ANSICODE was 
          set to -999.  Locations that came from sources other than GNIS or 2010Census_Gazetteer have a 
          value of -999 for both GNIS_ID and ANSICODE.  Some elevation values were added from topographic 
          map sources.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          City and town names from GNIS were modified to remove the feature type from the name; the 
          resulting name was used for all features taken from GNIS.  For features that came from 
          2010Census_Gazetteer, the Census name was used.  Remaining names were taken from the State base 
          maps, topographic maps, or State highway maps.  Name discrepancies were sent to the GNIS project team to 
          be resolved.

          Some features are included in GNIS both as "populated places" and as "census" or "civil" feature 
          types.  Duplicate features were identified and the "populated places" were deleted from the data.

          Population data were added to the file from 2010Census_Gazetteer.

          A final quality-control review was done and some city locations and names were adjusted based on 
          information from State Base Maps 1:500K, USA Topo Maps Map Service 100K, and Official State 
          Highway Maps.

          The National Atlas 1:1M Cities 2014 data set file name was changed to reflect the Global Map file-naming 
          convention.  Existing attributes were deleted except those required by Global Map, and the attribute 
          field names were modified to reflect the Global Map conventions.  The attributes f_code, ypc, and soc 
          were added and populated with the appropriate values.  The data were checked using the Global Map Data 
          Checker.
